	- Fixed menus not closing in combat
10.0.1
	- Several bugfixes
	- Updated zhTW locale, thx to a9012456
10.0
    - TT can replace the new totem bar, you select one of the new multicast spells with the new multicast button,
      Totems selected by rightclick in the totem menus are assigned to the selected multicast spell.
      A rightclick on the multicast button casts Totemic Recall (middleclick if menu is set to open on rightclick.)
    - Weapon Buff button now has a menu to choose buffs with a rightclick from
      instead of its old GUI settings, atm this menu opens on rightclick only
      (choose a weapon buff by rightclicking, cast it by leftclicking the weapon buff tracker,
       if you selected one of the buff combos (wf/fl, wf/fb) cast twice).
    - Spell assigned to the Weapon Buff button is saved for each talent spec and is changed on
      talent spec switch
    - Set totem order by shift-dragging, you should even be able to drag a totem onto your actionbars   
    - Frame positions saved in settings instead of cache only
    - Reenabled textures for warnings
    - Warnings now sent through LibSink
    - The range checker should consider buffs with the same effect as the active totem's buff
      (e.g. a player with Horn of Winter buff is considered to be in range of Strength Totem)
    - Updated ruRU, koKR, and zhTW localization, thanks to StingerSoft, Sayclub, and a9012456
    - Removed TT-Macro, the new multicast spells do a better job
    - Removed "Recast last totem", totems are chosen by rightclick only (would be awkward to select a totem by casting it
      when you're selecting it to be cast with other totems at once)
